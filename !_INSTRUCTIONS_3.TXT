And now you are ready to make the final executable version of the charts, this is simple too.


You have your chosen music, please rename them to;

music1.xm
music2.xm
music3.xm
music4.xm

and put them inside this directory, they will be automatically included.

The mag only plays tracker songs, I will not be changing this to play sids right now to save you
hassle. The other format I am considering is Farbrausch v2, they will come in a future
version.

You MUST have 20 valid include files so if you have not edited and converted your pages yet then
don't try and compile it, it won't work ;-)

You will want to open "configuration.txt" now.

Change the issue number, type some scroll about the songs and select which pages are active
inside the mag and the title of the pages in the menu with this file.

When you are done, save the file and double click "COMPILE-CHART.bat"

And that will be it, job done. After some time the mag will compile its self into a single exe :)
Please be aware that it may take several minutes to compile!


I look forward to seeing it used bro.
I worked like crazy to get it all finished and simple for you to use.
